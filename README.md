# dockerized_twitter_app
Built a twitter sentiment app with streamlit based on a dockerized pipeline using  mongodb, postgresdb and tweepy.

_Note: To run the code, a credentials.py file with personal Tweepy API keys and postgres info (see Dockerfile) needs to be added in the 'streamlit_app' folder._
